The unit test build requires CIME (https://github.com/esmci/cime) for the sake of various
CMake modules. In addition, the easiest way to build and run the unit tests is to use
CIME's run_tests.py script, which leverages machine configuration information from
https://github.com/esmci/ccs_config_cesm or something similar.

If you are testing this share code in the context of a CESM (or CAM, CTSM, etc.) checkout,
then you already have the required cime and ccs_config_cesm repositories in the correct
location. If not, you will need to obtain recent versions of cime and ccs_config_cesm,
checking them out alongside this share code repository.

If this share code is at the path /PATH/TO/CODE/share, then do the following:

   cd /PATH/TO/CODE
   git clone https://github.com/ESMCI/cime.git
   git clone https://github.com/ESMCI/ccs_config_cesm.git ccs_config
   cd share

Then build and run the unit tests with the following command; note that this reuses the
existing 'unit_tests.temp' directory (if present) in order to do an incremental rebuild of
the unit tests from the last time you ran them from this directory:

   ../cime/scripts/fortran_unit_testing/run_tests.py --build-dir ./unit_tests.temp --cmake-args " -DUNITTESTS=ON -DUSE_CIME_MACROS=ON"
